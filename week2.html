    <article>
        <p>Last week I explored potential projects I could work on for this class. Part of me wants to get my hands dirty with an Arduino board that utilizes a sensor to map out the dimensions of a room. However, I'm currently interviewing for a network engineering position that I will find out my status for by the end next week. If all goes well, I don't know much about networking and would love to build 2 basic LAN networks that can communicate with one another. This project will utilize layer 3 switches which I plan to read up on and interact with this week. I also will try to become familiar with Cisco's packet tracer software which will be needed for my project. Again this idea will be scraped if the network engineering opportunity falls through and I will devote more of my attention to building out the room dimension mapping device. </p>
        <p>As far as refining my workflow goes, I would like to be able to organize this coming week researching Arduino boards, layer 3 switches, and Cisco's packet tracer software into small manageable chunks I would like to read about. To me this is like how I would approach laying out requirements/features for a project. The organization will help me stay on topic and not veer too far off into the weeds as reading documentation tends to lead me.</p>
