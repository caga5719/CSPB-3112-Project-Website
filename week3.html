        <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
        <p> I continued researching an outline of what I would need for small enterprise networking project.  After researching and getting a better understanding of what I would need to build this network, I decided to push back my personal plans to build a room dimension mapping project with an arduino board. This was a tough decision but it was looking more and more logical for me to focus on building an small enterprise networking project as I really wanted and potentially need to build my understanding of networking. </p>
        <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
        <p> I plan on tinkering around more with Cisco Packet Manager as I work through researching the OSI model, TCP/IP basics, IP addressing, and subnetting fundamentals. I will also map out my business scenario (i.e. how many people are in the network, what departments (differing network privaleges), etc.) as well as other network requirements. Finally I will begin work on a network topology and IP addressing scheme that may carry into next week.</p>
        <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
        <p> This week is a little heavy on new topics I need to research. I need to make sure to focus on using my allocated time (1 hour 45 min) to research and make sure the rest of the time is used moving the project forward by actually coming up with network plans and documentation. There is no issue with an ad-hoc look up if need be.</p>
        <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
        <p> Separating key objectives into small manageable chunks like in an Agile workflow allowed to me to focus solely on single research items and not get bogged down on trying to remember all the different arudino board and networking topics I needed to research. I’m almost at the point where I may just set up a story board for every week if I find that it is a quick and effective use of my time.</p>
