        <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
        <p>Last week was bittersweet as I found out the company I interviewed with for the networking engineering
            position was putting a pause on hiring for the time being. That is life, and I'm still excited to be
            learning about networking and acquiring my CCNA sometime this year. That being said, I did also get reached
            out to interview for 2 other roles that very week, which is good, but that means I need to prep for
            interviews again.</p>
        <p>On the CCNA front, I wasn't able to get all 5 days of coursework done as last week was a test-heavy week for
            me. I was able to learn more about subnetting and IP addressing schemes and concluded I'll use an IPv4 Class
            C IP address range since my network is small and won't require many hosts.</p>

        <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
        <p>I plan on implementing my IP address scheme in my network as well as configuring the necessary routers and
            switches I need for my network. I hope to have a basic working network in Cisco Packet Tracer by the end of
            the week. I also plan to continue with at least 4 days' worth of courses in Jeremy's IT Lab's CCNA course
            and prep for my interviews next week.</p>

        <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
        <p>Next week is also a test-heavy week, so I will likely spend a little more time prepping for tests. I also
            need to prep for my next 2 interviews by practicing the STAR method and being ready to explain my projects
            and experience in depth. Other than that, I don't see much else getting in the way of me completing the
            necessary weekly tasks for my network project.</p>

        <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
        <p>I ended up refining my allocated daily routine from having 2-hour work segments to six 1.5-hour segments with
            smaller 30-minute breaks in between. I noticed I was getting burnt out too quickly in my 2-hour segments.
            From what I've researched online from experts like Andrew Huberman, 90 minutes is an ideal amount of time to
            expect to stay focused for. Hopefully this routine makes me even more productive.</p>
