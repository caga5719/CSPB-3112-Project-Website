        <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
        <p> I spent time learning the OSI model, TCP/IP model, and different kinds of network devices. After receiving
            some feedback on my proposal, I dove into Jermy's IT lab's CCNA course as my main source of upskilling and
            researching networking topics. Super glad I gave it a look as it's well planned out and offers Cisco Packet
            Tracer labs along with flash cards to help retain the information I've learned.</p>
        <p> As far as implementing my project goes, I wrote out the business requirements for my network and drafted my
            network topology. I quickly realized I could go even further down rabbit hole of functional, non-functional,
            user requirements, technical requirements etc., but chose to focus on the list of requirements attached to
            this post. If you see anything major I'm missing from a network requirements standpoint, please let me know.
        </p>
        <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
        <p> I plan on learning more about navigating through Cisco Packet Tracer, basic router and switch configuration
            commands, and interface configuration and IP addressing commands. I also plan on going further into the free
            CCNA course as it seems to be teaching me most of the things I need to do for the project in tandem with my
            weekly goals. On the implementation side, I would like to have my topology built out in packet tracer as
            well as configure routers and switches in my enterprise Packet Tracer Network. </p>
        <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
        <p> While I still haven't heard final word on the Networking opportunity (could be good or bad), I've gotten
            some traction with other companies and will likely have an OA coming my way in the next few days that I will
            need to prepare for. Long story short, I may need to spend a little more time preparing for interviews next
            week. </p>
        <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
        <p> I have a good process going right now. I'm utilizing an agile workflow for this project along with splitting
            up my days in 5 two-hour segments for whatever I need to work on. It’s a little extreme at first since I
            have to wake up quite early, but it helps that each break increments by 15 minutes (starting at 30 minutes)
            until I finish the day. Don’t think I will do this for the rest of my life but when juggling multiple
            classes, job searches, and projects it really makes things manageable.</p>
