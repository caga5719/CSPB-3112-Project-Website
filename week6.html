        <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
        <p>I was able to learn more about interacting with routers through the command line (Cisco IOS) and the
            different
            kinds of access that is granted, i.e User EXEC, Privileged EXEC mode, Global Configuration Mode, etc.. With
            the
            help of Jeremy's IT Lab's CCNA LAN Switching course, I was able to learn more about ARP (Address Resolution
            Protocol) and how it stitches together a server's IP address with the server MAC Address (unknown at initial
            request) from the perspective of the requesting client. I unfortunately was not able to get much more done
            on my
            private enterprise network as I've had to focus on other class exams and interviews.</p>
        <h3>What do you plan to do this week? Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
        <p>Realistically, I don't know how much time I'll have to add more pieces to my private enterprise network. I've
            fallen behind adding DHCP pools to the network which I was supposed to have added last week. Academically I
            have
            a PPL project I need to work on and a cybersecurity project that needs my attention. Good news and a little
            to my
            surprise, I've moved along in both of my interviews to another technical round and was reached out to today
            by
            another company for another likely screening, however, this also means more time prepping. It is a little
            funny
            how I went from almost radio silence on my applications to struggling to find time to prepare for
            interviews. I
            guess my luck comes in waves?</p>
        <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
        <p>I'm slowly coming to the realization that I can't follow the path of Jeremy's IT Lab's CCNA course and also
            research and implement the necessary features of my private enterprise network simultaneously in the limited
            time
            I have. After adding DHCP pools, I'm going to try and watch the videos and work the labs of the course based
            off
            the features I will add to my network on the given week. This means working and learning the CCNA course and
            labs
            out of order and filling out the missing pieces ad-hoc through my own research. Hopefully this works but I'm
            open
            to other ideas. I've also thought about trying to power through the course in hopes of building an
            understanding
            of how Networking concepts work together before building a project but the idea of not building on my own
            and only
            learning irks me.</p>
